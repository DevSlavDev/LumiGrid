# ✨ LumiGrid: Illuminate Your World! ✨

Welcome to the main LumiGrid repository! 🚀 This is the central hub for all things LumiGrid, an awesome ecosystem of interconnected hardware nodes designed to control all sorts of cool stuff like addressable LEDs, digital signage, and HDMI displays. 🌈

Think of LumiGrid as the brain 🧠 that helps you orchestrate your lighting and display setups with style and precision.

This project is brought to you by Cube & Reclame Fabriek, with development led by DevSlavDev.

## 📂 What's Inside?

This repository contains the core resources that tie the entire LumiGrid project together:

* `/docs/`:  Where you'll find all the documentation. User guides, developer docs, API references - the whole shebang! 📚
* `/utils/`:  A collection of handy-dandy utility scripts and tools. These might be Python scripts or other helpful resources used across different nodes. 🛠️
* `/presets/`:  Example preset files and schemas. Presets are like recipes for your nodes, defining specific behaviors or effects. 🎨
* `/config/`:  Configuration file templates and schemas. These help you set up your nodes just the way you like them. ⚙️
* `/web/`:  Shared front-end assets (HTML, CSS, JS). This ensures a consistent look and feel across all the node's web interfaces. 💅
* `README.md`:  That's me! 👋 The main entry point to understanding this repository.
